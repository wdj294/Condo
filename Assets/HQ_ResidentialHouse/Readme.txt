Hi!
Thank you for purchasing this package!

IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:

If doors, windows or switches doesn't work, please check Console for the help info.

All help information about Door and Switch scripts 
you can find in tooltips for almost all variables and properties in the inspector.

If you want to use this package with Unity 5.3.x and don't have Shader Forge, please write an email with request to support@not-lonely.com
and I will send you MaskedPBR shader, compiled for Unity 5.3.

IMPORTANT!

To achieve the same graphics as in the video demo and screenshots you have to be sure that you:
1. Set your project to Deferred Rendering Path (Edit -> Project Settings -> Player > Rendering Path: Deferred);
2. Set your project Color Space to Linear (Edit -> Project Settings -> Player > Color Space: Linear);
3. Switch your camera to HDR mode (Checkbox in the camera component);
4. Use Cinamtic Image Effects (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/51515).

That's all!
If you have any other questions, please write an email: support@not-lonely.com
