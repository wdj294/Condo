As per the Unity Asset store request to not put a .unitypackage on this package for
the samples and as the samples package can take a lot of time for importing.
I decided to post a link for you to freely download the examples.

/******* Link to examples: *********/

https://www.dropbox.com/s/qe7uvk37oqkibvs/ProDrawCallExamples.unitypackage?dl=0

/***********************************/

if you have any concern, any issue with the examples please let me know by either posting on the forums at:
