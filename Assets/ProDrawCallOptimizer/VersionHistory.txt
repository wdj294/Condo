Version 3.2
- If material has null textures and only uses color, then the generated UV will point to the middle of the material [0.5f, 0.5f] in order to avoid distortions on the combined mesh
- objects displayed on the objects GUI are now by default all closed, now when a new scene is opened the not optimizable objects will be shown.  (thanks to Mike for pointing this out)

- Added extra step when clearing atlas, now when clearing atlas you have to double click to clear an already baked atlas
Version 2.4
- Removed "Custom shaders" tab; now the tool calculates automagically the shader info of your custom shaders!, no more manual setup for custom shaders!.
- When "Create prefabs" is selected on the advanced tab, a small message in
the Objects GUI reminds the user the bake process will be slow.
- Small modifications for performance and support of Standard shader for Unity 5. (Still standard shader is not supported)
- "Not Optimizable" shaders now show in red, and the rest of recognized shaders are in black.
- Updated README.txt

Version 2.2
- Changed BuildTarget.iOS to BuildTarget.iPhone as it changed in Unity 4.5.5 in the atlasser
Version 2.1

Version 1.9.2
- Solved crash when object has more than 1 material, has different shaders and the shaders are not recognized
Version 1.9.1
- Solved crash problem when an object with more than 1 material had different shaders.
Version 1.9
- Tool now automagically supports any texture format. (it internally converts the texture to RGBA32, process it and then reimports back the texture to its original state)
- Normal textures are automatically marked as normal maps, if the tool cant figure out it will display a warning message.
- Atlasses automatically get set their closest import texture size i.e atlas size is: 3072, it gets set to 4096.
Version 1.8
- Added checkbox for generating prefabs for baked objects. (Unchecked by default), With this checked it takes _more_ time as it generates the meshes and prefabs for the objects.
--> For each gameobject a prefab gets generated regardless if its repeated or not.
- Changed token for optimized objects from =>ODCObj to .ODCObj so prefab generation gets done correctly when saving prefabs to the project.
- Re built all the examples with the new token (.ODCObj)
- Organized README to show better the tutorial and the contact info.
Version 1.7
- Organized link in README for intro video, now it points correctly.
